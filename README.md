## About
A variety of projects primarily written for NodeMCU board ESP8266, just exploring and learning!

## IDE
Using VS Code plugin for most of the development. Some reminders:

- Compile and run projects with `cmd + alt + u`
- Can change the project to be compiled in `.vscode/arduino.json -> sketch`. Delete the line entirely to be asked which project to run on next compile.
- `credentials.h` files are ignored as they can store passwords
